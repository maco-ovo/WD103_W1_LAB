# Week 1 Assignment: Multi-Page Static Website

## Objective

Build and deploy a multi-page static website using only HTML and CSS.  
JavaScript NOT required.

Publish the site on Netlify and submit the deployed link as a comment in the Google Classroom module (under Week1 Day 4 - LAB).

Your task is to reorganize content from an existing informational website into your own structured multi-page website.  
You are not designing a creative site. You are restructuring content using proper HTML semantics and CSS.

You may choose any topic you like (country, university, company, travel destination, hobby, etc.).  
You do not need to recreate an entire website. Select a reasonable amount of content and reorganize it across multiple pages.

## Pages

Create multiple HTML pages such as:

- index.html (Home)
- about.html
- projects.html or services.html (rename based on your topic)

All pages must:

- Include proper HTML document structure
- Use semantic elements: header, nav, main, section, footer
- Share a consistent navigation menu
- Use relative links between pages
- Indicate the current page using a CSS class

---

## Required HTML Elements

Across the site, include:

- Proper heading hierarchy (one h1 per page)
- Paragraph content
- A navigation list (ul > li > a)
- A content list (ul or ol)
- A table with:
  - caption
  - thead and tbody
  - proper th usage
- A quote using blockquote or q
- An image with meaningful alt text

---

## CSS Requirements

Use one external stylesheet (styles.css) linked to all pages.

Include:

- Class selectors
- An id selector
- Combinator selectors (descendant, child, adjacent sibling, or general sibling)
- A pseudo-class such as :hover, :visited, or :nth-child
- Multiple color formats (example: hex and rgb)
- Basic table styling (borders, spacing, header styling)

Keep layout simple. No Flexbox or Grid required.

## Project Setup

- Initialize an npm project
- Install live-server
- Add a start script
- Run the project locally using npm start

---

## Deployment

Deploy the project to Netlify.
