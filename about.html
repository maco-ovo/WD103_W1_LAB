            <p>Tractor was founded by Meghan and Steve Clarke with a simple goal: to create a place where people could eat healthy, delicious food every day. We wanted to offer nutritious meals that don't compromise on taste, replacing greasy, heavy fast food with fresh, high-quality ingredients.</p>
            
            <h2>Our Food Philosophy</h2>

                <li><strong>Clean Eating:</strong> No hidden ingredients, just fresh, whole foods.</li>
